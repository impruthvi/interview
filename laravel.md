# Most Asked Laravel Developer Interview Questions (With Answers)

## General Laravel Questions

1. **What is Laravel, and why is it popular?**
   Laravel is a PHP framework that follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. It is popular due to its elegant syntax, built-in tools like Eloquent ORM, routing, authentication, and Blade templating, and its large community support.
   
   **Reference:** [Laravel Official Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs)

2. **What are service providers in Laravel, and why are they important?**
   Service providers are the central place to configure and bind services in Laravel's service container. They are responsible for bootstrapping the application's features, like routes, events, and middleware.

   **Reference:** [Service Providers](https://laravel.com/docs/master/providers)

3. **Explain the lifecycle of a Laravel request.**
   - The entry point is `public/index.php`.
   - The request is passed to the HTTP Kernel.
   - The kernel processes middleware.
   - The request is sent to the router to match a route.
   - The matched route executes the controller method, which interacts with models and views.
   - The response is returned to the client.

   **Reference:** [Laravel Request Lifecycle](https://laravel.com/docs/master)

4. **What is Eloquent ORM, and how is it different from raw SQL queries?**
   Eloquent ORM is Laravel's built-in ORM that provides an elegant way to interact with the database using models. Unlike raw SQL queries, Eloquent allows working with database tables as PHP objects, making the code more readable and maintainable.

   **Reference:** [Eloquent ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/master/eloquent)

5. **What are middleware in Laravel? Can you provide an example of how to create and use them?**
   Middleware filters HTTP requests entering your application. For example, authentication middleware checks if a user is logged in before granting access to a route.

   To create middleware: `php artisan make:middleware CheckAge`

   Use middleware in a route:
   ```php
   Route::get('/profile', function () {
       // Your code here
   })->middleware('auth');
   ```

   **Reference:** [Middleware](https://laravel.com/docs/master/middleware)

## Routing and Controllers

6. **How does Laravel handle routing?**
   Laravel uses the `routes/web.php` and `routes/api.php` files to define routes. Routes can be defined using closures or controller methods.

   Example:
   ```php
   Route::get('/home', [HomeController::class, 'index']);
   ```

   **Reference:** [Routing](https://laravel.com/docs/master/routing)

7. **What is the difference between `Route::get()` and `Route::post()`?**
   `Route::get()` handles GET requests, typically used to fetch and display data. `Route::post()` handles POST requests, commonly used for submitting forms or creating resources.

   **Reference:** [HTTP Methods](https://laravel.com/docs/master/routing#the-method-field)

8. **What are resource controllers, and how do you use them?**
   Resource controllers provide a way to define CRUD routes automatically. Generate a resource controller:

   ```bash
   php artisan make:controller UserController --resource
   ```

   Register the resource controller in routes:
   ```php
   Route::resource('users', UserController::class);
   ```

   **Reference:** [Resource Controllers](https://laravel.com/docs/master/controllers#resource-controllers)

9. **How can you handle route model binding in Laravel?**
   Route model binding allows you to inject model instances directly into routes based on route parameters. Define it in a controller:
   ```php
   public function show(User $user)
   {
       return $user;
   }
   ```

   **Reference:** [Route Model Binding](https://laravel.com/docs/master/routing#route-model-binding)

10. **How do you redirect routes in Laravel?**
    Use the `redirect()` helper:
    ```php
    Route::get('/old-url', function () {
        return redirect('/new-url');
    });
    ```

    **Reference:** [Redirects](https://laravel.com/docs/master/redirects)
